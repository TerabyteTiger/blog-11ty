Something that's been really annoying me lately is how much Pokémon has become focused on monetization over competition and fun. People will only play in tournaments they deem "Worth their time" (read: meets their standard for prize payouts if they win) and I've been watching so many players focus on the _potential_ return that they lose focus of what they need to be doing in order to actually be in the running to get that return consistently. Anyone can run hot for a day and get lucky at just the right moments in order to pull out a win - that's part of the fun of card games. But many players seem to be plateauing way below their potential because they aren't playing the game, _they're just gambling_.

We have players that don't play online because there "isn't a reward" and it "isn't real practice" while we have regional champions saying that thier practice method was just playing tons of online games. Players that don't want to play games for fun at locals because there's nothing on the line and they "might leak their secret tech card(s)". Bad news buddy, if your tech card is actually go it won't matter if you hide it. Someone else will notice and share it or start playing with it, spreading it around anyways. Players that "can't get the cards they need" then refuse to order singles online, insisting on finding an opening booster packs (which is extra negative value given the state of the sealed market in 2025).

And I get it - a lot of people like opening packs. Personally, I don't need the high of opening packs. Except for the big hits, I'm usually more excited to open a card I need for play than a card that's worth $10-20. And even the big hits are only exciting to me because I can trade/sell it for cards I want to play with (which as a reminder - cards aren't worth their TCGplayer mid unless you actually trade/sell it).

And the worst part to me is watching people pass this attitude down to the younger playerbase.

I'm nothing special. I make bad meta calls and play subpar decks that I believe in more than any player should or because it has my favorite Pokémon in it (Sorry Ethan's Pichu, you just aren't the sauce Charizard needed). But I also know that I'm a player that a lot of the local kids look up to. The same kids that are excited to greet me when I walk in I will catch whispering "I hope I don't get paired against him" between rounds. One of the problems here is they care more about winning than getting better - and as a kid it can be hard if you're getting beat up and winning 0 games every week. But the kids that take a loss and come back the next week knowing the matchup inside and out? Those are the kids that inspire me to be a better player too.
