Welcome to my new "Pick of the Week" series, where I share something I've been enjoying during the past week! 

This week's pick is **Tinkering with Hardware**.

Traditionally, I've been more of a software guy - doing webdev for the immediate feedback loop when changes get made, editing photos where you can see the effect of changes instnatly, and generally preferring pre-built hardware. But [the times they are a-changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90WD_ats6eE). Hardware has become easier to get into and my patience has increased (at least I'd like to think so).

This past week I've spent time playing with a [Feather microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5345) and reminding myself how ~~great it is to live in the lawless world of JavaScript~~ Python works using [CircutPython](https://circuitpython.org/) to make a timer that's quick to reset for small amounts of time (15-90 seconds). 

Incidentally, creating the program was the easy part - the more overwhelming portion was looking through all the hardware and understanding how it all would piece together. Eventually, I stumbled upon this [very tiny DIY developer toy](https://github.com/PostHog/DeskHog). 

While I'm sure the DeskHog software is great, I actually just used this as a model for the 3D case and a shopping list so I could pretent to know what I was looking for on [Adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/). Everything has come together nicely and the process of getting everything connected and working has been (relatively) painless, and I look forward to doing some more work with microcontrollers in the future!
