{% alert "Pet Loss", "danger", "Content Warning" %}

Recently, we needed to say goodbye to our loveable fluffball Zoey after only 3 short years üíî

I've thought about this post every day since it happened, and have started and restarted it almost as many times.

I'm so glad that I had talked about pet loss with an old co-worker many years ago. She mentioned that the worst part was the silence. I thought I knew what she meant. I didn't. Nothing could have perpared me for how loud silence could be.

It doesn't help that this so sudden and she was a velcro dog while we were home. Always "helping" us cook dinner and empty the dishwasher and staying by my side during late night gaming sessions. The second I made some keyboard click-clacks to wake my PC she'd come running to the room and plop herself on the floor or in her pen for a snack.

And as if this wasn't hard enough, it's had a secondary pain tacked on. When we got Zoey, she orginally shared the name of my Grandmother who had just recently passed away at that time (also suddenly).

Since it happened, something I've been really struggling with is the balance between not wanting to see things that remind me of her, while also wanting nothing but to feel like she's still around. It's just sucky all around, but I'm so happy that I got to spoiler her for the 3 years that we did have together.

Hug your local velco-pet and tell them you love them for me üíï
