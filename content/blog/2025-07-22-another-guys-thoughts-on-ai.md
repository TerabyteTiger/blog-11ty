One of my recent favorite blogs to subscribe to has be [Where's your Ed at](https://www.wheresyoured.at/) and I particularly enjoyed the most recent post ["The Hater's Guide To The AI Bubble"](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/) in which Ed pulls a lot of sources outlining the obvious money problem causing a bubble. I highly recommend reading through it, but note that it is a rather long and in depth read.

For fairness and context, I haven't personally tried very much with LLMs, but just in my experience with companies shoving it down my throat I've seen enough to know that it just isn't doing what the companies are claiming.

## Home Assistants

I think the most constant reminder for me personally is how rapidly Google Home has gone downhill since the implementation of Gemini started. I've been using Google Home devices regularly throughout my home since the mini dropped in 2017 - primarily as speakers, with smart switches, and to easily set timers via voice command (usually while cooking).

But at some point "Hey Google, set a 3 minute timer" started more and more frequently setting a _30_ minute timer instead of 3 minutes. And more recently it's sometimes just not setting timers for us at all, or cancelling the timer if we ask it another question (no, the timers aren't just being pushed to the background - the device is responding to the question with "Ok, cancelling your timer").

I've also felt this degredation in Android Auto's voice search too. For some reason it will sometimes decide that I didn't want to navigate to the location, but would rather hear the deatils about what the location is -- an issue that had not happened until this past year.

## Support Chatbots

If the voice assistant issues were papercuts, the new wave of support chatbots has been like getting bricks thrown at me.

For starters, it seems like even when you eventually get to an actual person the chatbot's history isn't visible to the support person (or if it is they sure don't act like it is). Why do I need to explain everything again to a person after explaining the same thing to a chatbot? The most egregious of these experiences was when I was processing a return on Amazon for a package that showed up empty. I reached the end of the process with the chatbot and when using the auto-response button for how to refund me, the bot didn't know what to do and kicked me to a person (where I had to re-explain the situation and wait for a manager to approve the refund - which is insane since the chatbot was ready to give it to me already).

## Search Results

The final place I've been seeing AI degradation of quality is search results - so much so that it's convinced me to give up Google and swap to [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) earlier this year. There's something magical about actually finding results right away and not needing to scroll past ads and the AI summary to get to the page you're looking for. I know for a lot of people DDG is good enough of a substitute, but I was extremely unimpressed with their results and ended up reaching for Google too frequently. With Kagi I don't have that experience, and I can specify that I want specific sites to be boosted if they're in the results, which alone has been worth paying for.
