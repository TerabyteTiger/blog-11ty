The primary way I communicate with family members that want to be vaguely aware of what I'm up to is via Snapchat currently. And as is the nature of Snapchat, eventually you end up on a snapstreak with someone and neither of you wants to be the person that breaks the 804 days of mostly monotonous pictures of the view from the office desk or a blurry picture of each other's pets.

But the beauty is hidden in the fact that **most days aren't exciting**. And that makes the unexpectedly exciting snap feel so much cooler. Suddenly the "just another picture of their desk" becomes a video of their hand being eaten by a cow, and that's just plain fun.
