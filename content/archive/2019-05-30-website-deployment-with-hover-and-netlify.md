> **This post is not sponsored, I just really like Nelify & Hover**

## Intro

You've been working for weeks, slinging code in every spare moment. But now you're ready. Ready to show everyone the amazing new site you've built.

**But how?**

In this post, I'll walk through the process of getting your site on Netlify through GitHub, adding a custom domain from Hover, and setting up sub-domains (if you're unfamiliar with sub-domains, don't worry! We'll go over that later on).

_You can purchase domains from Netlify directly. I prefer Hover, so that's what I'll be demonstrating here. Any domain provider should offer a similar process._

## Prerequisites

-   [Github Account](https://github.com/) (Or GitLab or BitBucket - whichever you prefer)
-   [Netlify Account](https://app.netlify.com)
-   [Hover Account](https://www.hover.com/) - This is only required if you will be purchasing and connecting a custom domain through hover.
-   Create a GitHub Repository for your site and upload your files there.

### How to Github

If you need help with the last prerequisite, feel free to reach out to me or see if these articles help:

## Deploy to Netlify

The first step is to get your site on Netlify. From [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com), click the **New site from Git** button.

![Netlify's green button labeled "New site from Git"](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/35jurllgogd130u0sgxm.PNG)

On the next page under "Continuous Deployment", select "GitHub" (or your git service of choice).

![Screenshot of the continuous deployment section on Netlify. Options for Github, GitLab, and Bitbucket are shown.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/catyyjqhml8qulyr4fas.PNG)

This will open a new window to authenticate your GitHub account. Sign in and approve the connection (once reading the fine print, of course). Now you'll get to pick which repository you want to deploy from. For me, I'll be using my "really-bad-designs" repository.

![Wizard step for selecting which repository on Github to select. Shown, a search for "Really" has returned a single repository.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ilrqzolgkw4o8k9wk82l.PNG)

Now you will inform Netlify which branch you want to deploy from, as well as the build process if you're using a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).

In my case, I'm only deploying `index.html` and `index.css` files, so I don't have a build process. Once ready, click the **Deploy Site** button and you'll be directed to a page that looks roughly like this:

![Deploy settings page. Options for selecting the owner, branch, build command, and publish directory are shown, as well as a "Show advanced" button. Below all of this, an aqua "Deploy Site" button.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/guyjuuusur9kxy1oz3wh.PNG)

The important thing on this page is that initially you'll see "Site deploy in progress". This means Netlify is in the process of deploying your site. For future deployments, your site will still be available while Netlify builds (one of the many reasons Netlify is so awesome!) and you can track build processes from this page.

![Netlify Dashboard with yellow indicators that the site is in the process of being deployed.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j4z8xbqpnssnilvf775r.PNG)

After a minute or two, refresh your page and you'll see the "Site deploy in progress" message has changed into a URL. If you click/navigate to this URL, you'll see that your site is live and available to the world!

## Applying a Custom Domain

As cool as [agitated-keller-fb140b](https://agitated-keller-fb140b.netlify.com/) is, I really want to update it to my custom domain - [reallybad.design](https://reallybad.design)!

Before applying a custom domain, we have to make sure we own the domain. If anyone could route [google.com](https://tvanblargan.com) to their personal website, imagine the chaos!

### Purchasing a domain from Hover

Hover makes the finding and purchasing a domain process easy! From [Hover's home page](https://www.hover.com/), type your desired name into the search box and it will show you available domains (or similar domains) and how much they cost.

![Hover.com search for "reallyBad" and a list of available domain names.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dk7lo2z8vs36so86dftm.PNG)

Once you find one you like, click the **+** icon to add it to your cart and click **Proceed to Cart** on the right hand side (Cart icon in header on mobile). From here, add your payment information and proceed through checkout.

![Hover.com search for "reallyBad" and a list of available domain names. A cart summary is shown on the right with a "Proceed to cart" button.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/t2d5ms1oo0erqj88en7g.PNG)

Congrats! You just bought your domain! ðŸŽ‰

### Connecting to Netlify

Once purchased, head to [www.hover.com/control_panel/domains](https://www.hover.com/control_panel/domains) and click **your domain name**. This will bring you to the following dashboard-like page:

![Hover.com dashboard. Key points include tabs for settings pages, the annual renewal price, and easy connection options for select sites such as Etsy or Squarespace.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/h5yf6yh26y5jp13w4wgc.PNG)

You'll click on the **DNS tab**, which will direct to a list of records.

![DNS listings for reallybad.design. Two A records, an MX record, and a CNAME record exist, all added by Hover upon domain purchase.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fz0z0o072q4bwysg1uwd.PNG)

> _Optional Step:_ You can delete the 2 default "A" records (Type A, Value 64.98.145.30). I choose to do this for the sake of keeping the list less cluttered, but there shouldn't be any difference if you decide to keep them.

Now back on Netlify, you'll click **Set up a custom domain** under the "Getting Started" card. This will bring you to the below page where you will enter your new domain name (for me, `reallybad.design`). Click **Verify** once entered, then **Yes, add domain** when prompted to verify that you own the domain.

![Netlify add custom domain wizard, step 1. A textbox for the domain name and a "Verify" button are shown. "Reallybad.design" is typed in the box.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ze21wjqnwop7kxhpavle.PNG)

This will redirect you to the Domain settings within Netlify. You'll notice at the top of the list that there are warnings about "Check DNS Configuration". Click one of these (I'm starting with the non-`www` one).

![List of custom domains configured for the site. Shown are a Netlify default domain, reallyBad.design, and www.reallyBad.design. The really bad design sites have a warning to check DNS configuration.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/l29igv3ajf2c6k75977n.PNG)

Hover doesn't (currently) support ANAME or ALIAS records, so we'll use the alternate option of pointing an A record to the listed IP address. On the Hover domain list, click **Add a record** and input `*` as the host name and the IP provided by Netlify as the value. Repeat with `@` as the host name.

reallybad.design:
![Creating a DNS record on Hover. Type is A, Hostname is *, IP address is 104.198.14.52, and Time to Live (TTL) is Default 15 minutes.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/un56w55dac5mq9ufz0by.PNG)

www.reallybad.design:
![Creating a DNS record on Hover for www subdomain. Type is CNAME, Hostname is WWW, Target name is a default Netlify subdomain, and Time to Live (TTL) is Default 15 minutes. ](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/g3g3apglxi7vrd0ux54u.PNG)

_Note: Time to live (TTL) is the amount of time it will take for your changes to take effect. Additionally, it may take up to 24 hours for the www address to propagate._

### Configure HTTPS

Once you no longer see the "Check DNS configuration" error (may require refreshing and patience), scroll to the bottom of the Domain Management page and you'll see a section for "HTTPS" that will initially look like this:

![HTTPS section of Netlify's Custom Domain settings page. The status is "Waiting on DNS propagation" and buttons are available to verify DNS configuration or Provide your own certificate.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d394rl74cc3q30uwmpup.PNG)

The cool part of Netlify is that you don't have to do anything to configure this (unless you want to add your own custom SSL certificate)! It may take up to a day to see the HTTPS show properly, but it should look like this once setup:

![SSL/TLS Certificate showing under HTTPS section of Netlify's Custom Domain settings page. Details about the certificate are shown including when it was created, when it was updated, and when it auto-renews before.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ylqu30mtc0005sp1v6zr.PNG)

### Site is Live!

At this point, your main site is setup and live - HTTPS and all!

Hover:![List of DNS records on Hover's DNS listing tab. Records include the default Hover MX and CNAME records, a CNAME record for www, and two A records for * and @.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r9jrjn0z5dl0xknoku0m.PNG)

Site: [reallybad.design](https://reallybad.design)

## Deploying to a subdomain

So now we have `reallybad.design` and `www.reallybad.design` deployed, but what if we want to deploy `really.reallybad.design`? This is what is known as a subdomain - Let's walk through the process!

### What are "subdomains"?

I'm not going to go too much into that here, but at a high level, subdomains are `othersite.yourwebsite.com`. If you want to know more about them, I recommend these awesome posts:

<a class="dev" href="https://dev.to/joshhadik/true-your-side-projects-with-a-single-domain-3716">Organize your side projects with a single domain</a>

<a class="dev" href="https://dev.to/flaque/what-wait-why-heroku-doesnt-want-you-to-be-naked-1j0h">Why Heroku doesn't want you to be naked</a>

### Deploy the new site

To start, we will setup a new Github repository and follow the **Deploy to Netlify** steps above and jump back here once you hit the **Applying a Custom Domain** section.

### Point Subdomain to new site

At this point, you should be at the Netlify Dashboard which should look similar to this:
![Netlify dashboard for a new site that has just been deployed from a Github Repository.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ftjw9fkhv7wn4c846xfg.PNG)

Once again, we will be clicking the **Set up a custom domain** link. On the new page, you'll type in the subdomain that you would like to set. For me, that will be `really.reallybad.design`.

![Netlify add custom domain wizard, step 1. A textbox for the domain name and a "Verify" button are shown. "really.reallybad.design" is typed in the box.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fek0ydbmx4v78sku8lc3.PNG)

Then click **Verify** and **Yes, add domain** once the message to verify that you own your domain appears.

**That's it!** Your site is now live at your designated subdomain!

### HTTPS for subdomain

At this point, you may see this message about not being setup for HTTPS:

![The HTTPS section of Netlify's Custom Domain Settings page with an error that "We could not provision a Let's Encrypt certificate for your custom domain."](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uv967ypj4hjlsu9ipymd.PNG)

In the background, Netlify is working on handling this for you, and may take a few minutes to process, but shouldn't require any additional input from you.

If you are still seeing this error after ~30 minutes, you can click through the **Verify DNS Configuration** prompt. If the error is still hanging around after a day or so, I would recommend reaching out to Netlify Support. I had to resolve a certificate issue in the past and they make it very easy were very friendly!

## Closing

Thanks for reading about Hover + Netlify to deploy a website! If you use this to deploy something, let me know below - I'd love to see!

Additionally, reallybad.design and really.reallybad.design are open source, so feel free to help make the site worse (better?)!
