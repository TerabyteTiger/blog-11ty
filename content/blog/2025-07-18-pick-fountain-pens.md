This week's pick is **Fountain Pens**.

Anyone that's been around me for a while has either seen me using or heard me talk about fountain pens and how much fun it is to find new inks and write with different pens. It all started 2 years ago when I got a [TWSBI ECO](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/twsbi-eco-fountain-pen-transparent-purple-special-edition) for my birthday, then started buying a few more pens and inks this year after doing regular journalling.

There's just something so much better about writing things down and drawing than anything a mouse and keyboard can do. Write something down today üòÅ
