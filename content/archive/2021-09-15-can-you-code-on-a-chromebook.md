<h2 id="tldr"> <a href="#tldr" aria-describedby="fn-1">TL;DR</a></h2>

Yes! There are [online options like Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and [VS Code can be installed locally on newer chromebooks](https://terabytetiger.com/lessons//chromebook-coding-kickoff/).

## How to program on a Chromebook

### Online editors

The lowest barrier to entry for coding that can be done on any device connected to a web browser is to use one of the many available online editors. They all have different offerings, but these are some of my favorites:

#### Code Sandbox

[Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is a great option if you'd like to use your chromebook for web development. Code Sandbox offers the ability to work with many JavaScript frameworks including Vue, React, and even Node.js!

#### Repl.it

[Repl.it](https://replit.com/) is going to be the option for you if you're looking to try out other languages than JavaScript - my recommendation is to try out [Python](https://replit.com/languages/python3)!

#### Codepen

[Codepen](https://codepen.io) is the go-to if you want to try something in HTML/CSS/JS! It's great for creating small samples or concepts and includes the ability to pull in external packages!

#### Github.dev Repository Web Editor

If you're familiar with [GitHub.com](https://github.com) from [my git introduction posts](https://terabytetiger.com/lessons/crash-course-git-lingo/) you may want to try out the Github.dev editor - just replace `github.com` with `github.dev` in the URL of any repository and a web-based VS Code editor will load up the repository for you!

### Installing VS Code

If you'd rather install VS Code as a local code editor, you can do so by [enabling Linux on your compatible chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en), then installing the [official package](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you'd like more details about installing VS Code on a Chromebook, I have a [more detailed post you can read](https://terabytetiger.com/lessons/chromebook-coding-kickoff/)
