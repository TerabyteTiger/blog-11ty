It's only been a few weeks(?) since Gemini got forced into Gmail, and I'm already so over the fact that there's always a block of usually inaccurate tracking information at the top of Gmail when I open it. It's particularly great when it's telling me I have packages out for delivery that were delivered a week earlier ðŸ™ƒ

I hope someday they give us the option to turn this off...
