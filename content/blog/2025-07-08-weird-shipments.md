Recently I experienced what I believe was the strangest online order shipment I've ever had.

I ordered a new 3D printer which was estimated to arrive in 3-10 business days. The first oddity happened when later that day I had an update email saying the package had shipped and would arrive the next day (Saturday). Then I got a second notice saying a package had shipped (with no specific arrival date). So I looked into it, and apparently the bundle I ordered ships in 3 seperate packages -- which would seem perfectly reasonable except that all 3 packages were shipping from different towns in New Jersey and with a different shipping provider ðŸ¤£
