|- "Not" character while in a grouping
|- [^abc] will match any char that isn't a, b, or c
|- "Starts with" character outside groupings
|- ^ok will match any string that starts with "ok"

$
|- "Ends with" character
|- end$ will match any string ending with "end"

_Everything in a pattern is a char to match!!_

`abc` will match exactly "abc"

## Groups

```
[] - Match exactly 1 of the inner characters

() - Capture Group
|- Returns only captured grouping instead of full string
|- Useful for returning results
|- Can be nested to return multiple groups
|- Returned from outer -> inner, left -> right

{} - Quanity to match
|- a{3} - matches exactly "aaa"
|- a{1,3} - matches any of "a", "aa", or "aaa"
|- .{2-6} - matches any string of 2-6 chars

```

## Whitespaces

```
_ = Space

\t = tab

\n = new line

\r = carriage return (Windows ðŸ˜‰)

\s = any whitespace character
```
