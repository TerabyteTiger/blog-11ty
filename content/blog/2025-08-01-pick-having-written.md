A YouTube video I was listening to in the background this morning had a quote in it that went something like

> "I don't enjoy the act of writing, but I enjoy having written."

And while on some days, that couldn't be farther from the truth for me - there are also days where I don't feel like writing, but do end up feeling better after having written things down. Writing and forcing yourself to slow down and process your thoughts has been a great resource for me recently. From helping realizing I was starting to tilt in the video game I was playing to finding solutions to the programming bug I was working on, writing things down (on paper) is a great way to get your brain jogged!
